# Misinformation Tracker

___Sub-Problem___

I created a web app for users to report misinformation and hate speech content to TrustLab that is added to Firebase and can later be added to the data store.

___Solution Approach___

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the front-end web app where users can enter their own misinformation. I used Firebase to store the misinformation and timestamp; Firebase allows for easy scaling and access of the database. I used Python and Jupyter notebooks to pull the data from Firebase and perform some analysis, such as TF-IDF.

___Dependencies___

I am using JQuery and Bootstrap on the front-end and the Python Firebase package for data analysis.

___How to run my code___

Open index.html to go to the web app. Then, run the notebook to perform data analysis.
